      <p>Hello! I’m Harshith, a VLSI design enthusiast and graduate student specializing in FPGA systems, digital design, and hardware verification.</p>
      <p>I find joy in building hardware systems that are fast, reliable, and efficient. From designing RAM cells in Cadence Virtuoso to developing pipelined MIPS processors in Verilog, I enjoy working across abstraction levels—from transistor-level layout to RTL to FPGA-level testing. I take pride in my ability to debug complex timing issues and optimize circuits for area, power, and speed.</p>
      <p>When I’m not coding or designing, I love documenting my projects and helping others learn through my technical blog and open-source contributions. I'm always looking to grow by taking on challenging hardware design and verification problems.</p>
      <p>
        I’m deeply passionate about digital design, system-on-chip architectures, and high-speed verification. I specialize in RTL, synthesis, timing closure, and verification using SystemVerilog and UVM. I'm constantly learning to build better and faster hardware systems that help advance today's embedded and cloud technologies.
      </p>
      <p>
        I enjoy collaborating on FPGA-based accelerator projects, processor architectures, and custom digital blocks for SoC design. Outside of work, I love sharing knowledge through workshops and mentoring peers in digital design and VLSI flow concepts.
      </p>
      <p>Thanks for stopping by!</p>
